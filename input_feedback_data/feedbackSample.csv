With a DV cert, clicking on the padlock displays e.g. for mozilla.org:    Mozilla Foundation    (Secure Connection)        This information is already conveyed by the green padlock and the ""Mozilla Foundation (US)"" text next to the full URL, so clicking on the padlock doesn't actually, as a user, give me any meaningful info (it actually gives me *less*).        To get to the issuer name and other cert details, I have to 1) click the padlock and 2) click the arrow next to Secure Connection. Why not display that in the first level of the padlock menu?        With a non-DV cert, the situation is even worse (e.g. with https://www.videolan.org) as the two clicks will only give me the cert issuer's name, nothing else.        For mixed content (e.g. https://www1.sunrise.ch/), I'll get a warning that the connection is not secure when clicking on the padlock/warning sign. Going down to the second menu won't give me any more information (the same warning message is repeated and I can't even see the issuer's name).        Could we maybe merge both levels of the padlock menu?    It seems that if a user merely wanted to check if the connection was secure, the green padlock is all they would look for. Forcing them through two clicks/levels to get a bit more info seems like a waste.        Also, reaching the Certificate Viewer to get proper cert details takes me 4 (!) clicks starting from the padlock and I really need to know what to look for.    While I do agree that most users won't understand that info or won't look for it, I'm surprised it is buried so deep. The same goes for TLS version/ciphers (requires 3 clicks).        I am well aware that Mozilla did a bunch of UX research before making these choices, I thought I'd just drop my 2 cents in. Is there any forum or mailing list where these UX choices are being discussed?"

I have consistently and vigorously refused and removed all applications that use the so called cloud, which is most likely a huge invasive privacy hole.        4) For this reason, I have begun searching for a truly secure Web browser to use in place of Firefox which will store MY DATA ON MY HARD DRIVE!  I have no sympathy for those lame enough to want a netbook or mobile phone to surf the Web on.  Let them use the mobile phone version!          For this reason, and since there has been no movement to a branch I'm willing to use, all the machines I own and support from now on will have some other Web Browser installed.  That is about 134 units lost.  Have a NICE DAY somewhere else!"

The first one is serious: I lose the keyboard everytime I clear the cookies (Show Cookies -> Remove all). I don't lose all keys though. Enter and Ctrl+keys and a few others still work, but not letters and numbers alone, meaning I can't type anything, not even virtual on-screen keyboards work. The even more serious part is that this affects the whole OS (Windows 7 74-bit) and only a reboot will solve the problem. Mouse behaviour is not affected. This didn't happen with the previous version of Firefox.        The second problem is that the file download speed drops dramatically (six fold in my case) when loading up a very large PDF file. As soon as you close the PDF file tab before it has finished, the download speed increases again."

Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things?????

Many of our users are not technically savvy and we do our best to be very clear and succinct in the information we display.        I was very disappointed to learn how Firefox handles the window.onbeforeunload event as first implemented in this bug report (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=588292).        Unfortunately the message provided by FF is more confusing for my customers than it is helpful. When a customer gets to the review page some have a tendency to think the order is place and leave. We use onbeforeunload to show the message 'Your order has not been placed. Are you sure you want to leave?'.  However the Firefox message says 'data will not be saved'. For these customers that are already confused because of not reading the page carefully this message is nonsensical, even spammy.        I understand the behavior was set for a reason, it has been that way for some time, and the discussion about it 2 years ago cause a raucous. But is there no way this behavior can be presented for consideration again?  Other browsers fight the phishers by pre/postfixing the site-defined message with clear notices and well marked buttons. Is that method not good both for developers and users?"

The implied trend towards mandatory advertising and no free downloads of videos would seem to be implied in losing Firefox for more ""domesticatable"" items; in other words, a concrete step towards the latter.  I donated because of my well-rewarded use of Firefox so far, but see no way to continue. The psychological separation and programming from a jittery malfeasant malicious cursor cannot be endured even for Firefox."

Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous.

However, I'm increasingly leaning toward switching to Chrome due to Firefox's increasing tendency to crash/freeze randomly on occasion, as well as the new addition of ads (or sponsored links if you prefer that euphemism) in the new tab page. These are particularly egregious given their put in a location where you'd normally find a friendly link you were actually looking for. This is the same reason no one uses yahoo search. If you guys are really that scrapped for cash (which I have my doubts) and want to stick a banner ad at the bottom of the new tab page, I wouldn't care that much, it's much less obtrusive that way.

Like many I  use it but do not understand the coding or software processes that make it tick.  As a result my participation in development is nil.          With that being said I unhappily have had to limit myself from using it since it has become in my case relatively useless on YouTube and severely hampered when attempting to view movie on line.  I understand you're divorrce with FLASH but the resultant rendering of HTML is spotty, the uploads hand when played and all your advice to remedy the situation is useless..        Chrome or Opera do not result in the same behaviour but unfortunately the audio on full screen is not as clear as FFox's when operating correctly.  Lately, I get decent results from some of the hybrid versions such as BlackHawk or Mustang but sincerely wish I could use a Mozilla product because of the great range of useful addons.        I assure you it is not a failure of my computer or Shaw provider - nor is it because of other running processes.  Only Mozilla based browsers seem so woefully inadequate on YouTube.  I hope you get your GOOD browsers running and available again soon.        Smitty"

My suggestion is an addition to the plugin check page, a 4th column which lists the actual live current version of each plugin. Perhaps this column could be optional and disabled by default, but I wouldn't think so.        The current plugin check version numbers are manually maintained by mozilla, and sometimes there will be a lag time of 2 days, perhaps sometimes due to a minor compatibility issue with the plugin such as the current tab muting issue with flash. So, this new extra list for the 4th column could also be manually maintained, it would just be a lot quicker because nobody needs to check anything, they just keep that column up to date. OR, there could be a more automated solution, such as a system where plugin makers will use an API or something where they are responsible for filling in the new version each time they make a release, Or, perhaps you could use some kind of scraper that checks the vendor web page once an hour or something like that.         With my suggestion, everything could work the way it does now, with Firefox catching up and/or vetting new plugin versions just like they do now, but with the additional column the user would be empowered with more accurate information.            The reason for my suggestion is that the way the Plugin Check page and feature presents itself is as a true live check against current versions of the plugins.        When you go to Add-ons Manager, it has a link that says ""Check to see if your plugins are up to date"". When you click on that it goes to the plugin check page. Between that link text and everything presented on the plugin check page, it completely gives the user the impression that the plugin check is actually checking to see if your plugins are literally up to date - ie: when it shows the green thumbs up and tells you your version of Flash is up to date, the user thinks that 100% their flash is up to date, and that if they checked on the Adobe site, there would not be a newer version.        But that is not always the case. Firefox manually maintains a list of current plugin versions, and it can sometimes lag two days behind. Hence my suggestion above.        The problem is that users are not getting accurate information, and not only that, they are sometimes getting misinformation, where they will think they have the latest version when they don't. This is a somewhat important issue because when a plugin releases a security patch that solves you know, 80 security flaws, you don't want the user to think they are protected from those when they aren't."

Well, it's all because of the incompatibility of the FULL functionality of the Norton Toolbar, specifically the ID Vault/Safe.    I PREFER FIREFOX FOR MY BROWSER!    But, after waiting over a month for Norton to fix the compatibility issues, I got tired of having to copy/paste my credentials into all the websites that I use every single day that requires my user name and password.  I HAVE TO HAVE THE USE OF THE NORTON ID VAULT!    So, after putting it off, hoping an praying it would be resolved, at least fairly quickly, AND THEN SEEING HOW NORTON SAID IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, I had to stop using Firefox and now have no other choice but to go with Chrome, yuck....BUT, I have the ID VAULT back, I am completely dependent on it.    I want to come back to Firefox, but without the NORTON ID VAULT, I can not!    PLEASE, isn't there anything you can do on your end???    Why do you roll out updates so much and so quickly, before seeing what ALL IT MAY CAUSE?    Sincerely,    Susie D.    PS:  Can you PLEASE let me know when and if it EVER gets working again?

The other problem is that the options tab is opened at random times while I am on line. Sometimes it opens two or three times.

Usually I get a message saying Java has stopped, or something like that and it let's me stop it so then I can close it. I've had to close it by control+alt+delete the last few times I've opened Firefox. Please fix, I love Firefox and don't want to stop using it."

Immediately the ""share it"" window closes, and I lose everything I'd typed in, and have to start over.  Yes, I have sort of curbed doing it, but like with switching on a light switch during a power failure, I still do it.        Add the fact I can by typing on the page, and hit an erroneous key and the window will snap shut, all of my typing lost, and it can be frustrating.  I guess it's human nature, but most of the time the second offering is just an aborted shorthand attempt at recreating something like I had, with irritation included.        Question is--isn't there some way you can do this where I can check other tabs, then come back and finish my share on the tab I am sharing?  And perhaps stall it's shutting with some sort of warning, requiring a click,when I hit some odd key on the bottom row (usually, I'm guessing, because I type pretty fast).  I wish you could address this, in your next update.

First, allow a user to sign in to the Firefox browser that allows you to save your favorite sites and can then can be accessed from any computer and any device simply by signing in to your custom browser.  This means you don't have to separately save the sites to bookmarks on ever computer or devise you use, just sign in and one entry does it all.  This is what makes things like Google email and calendar so useful and would be equally useful for browser use.  Second, allow a bookmarks button on the smart phone to pull up your saved favorite sites.

The last fifteen + days at least I can NO LONGER copy and paste txt etc from a website with HTML in it and have that HTML formatting show up in the pasted document into a Thunderbird Email.  What have you done with that function?  How do I fix it in about:config or other settings to get my functionality back and WHY have you removed the + from the new tab button.  Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous. Making Firefox less and less useful to the average user is NOT desirable behaviour. Pointless change for the sake of it?

If you can fix this it would be appreciated since I use that site every day.    Firefox has been crashing lately more than ever. I have Bitdefender and Malwarebytes. When Firefox crashed it tried to send a report and was unable to. Firefox is also slower than it used to be.        Another maybe unrelated thing is that Malwarebytes intermittently  disables itself. Originally I had the free pgm and then the paid one but first removed them all and then re-downloaded the paid one and restarted the computer. It still disables itself intermittently.    Contact me at the below email address if I can provide other specifics.    Thank you."

This forces me to use internet explorer which spends so much time gathering meta data on every keystroke and web address (my opinion) that it slows to a crawl.

At least they don't seem to have the issues your browser does with things like Flash, which I have waited several years for you to fix, to no avail.

I run Ookla in chrome - I get over 100Mbit download and 10Mbit upload. Firefox still poorly. I uninstalled Delicious. Still seeing the paper aeroplane icon. I uninstalled and re-installed Firefox. Still seeing paper aeroplane icon. I clear all my history, I delete my profile. I refresh firefox to factory. I create a new profile. Still poorly. I work though the Firefox going slow hints and tips, VERY slowly, since firefox very slow. My son says use Google DNS servers (already set to Google DNS servers), I do safe mode. Still poorly. I do restart. Safe mode is fine. Normal mode is fine. Pure joy. Next time I will work through firefox's own recommendations. Maybe you need a better SEO on ""Firefix going slow"" in Google. And maybe you could review the sequence of suggestions. I just spent three hours on this. I run Windows 10 with the default Updates settings. Oh, yes, second time I was clearing history (due to other web instructions earlier) Firefox hung, had to be closed using Task Manager.

Having seen FF users complaining about Firefox's high CPU utilization. I decided to take a quick look at what is going on, and behold, yes it does use a lot and a lot of CPU. Like 40-60% total CPU of a dual core with four instances of Firefox running with a total of 20 tabs. The only other window was Task manager, from where my CPU data comes.    All four instances of FF were in full screen mode so that only one tab from one instance was on the screen at any one time.     Now here is the interesting part.     When I hit ""Show Desktop"", and all window instances were minimized, the total CPU immediately went down to 3% to 9%.     When I hit ""Show Desktop"" again, restoring the status of the desktop, the total CPU used by Firefox went back up to the 40% to 60% utilization.     I did this a dozen times and the result where always the same.    I thought you may want to know.    PS: It would be nice is you sent me a copy of this to my email, I shall see."

But with this unzipped file there's no Firefox app icon anywhere to be seen in any of the unzipped v42 folder.        How do I switch back to v42 if I can't find the Firefox app icon in the unzipped file folder? I don't want to open any of the 59 items of gobbledy-gook because I don't want to lose my Firefox prefs configuration or my bookmarks.        Please answer soon as I want to have access to CNN again. Then I'll wait 6mths before allowing another update, to give you time to iron out this bug in v43. It definitely isn't due to any problem at my end. Thanks.

Same Same as previously. Listen to feedback?????? The last 19 + days at least I can NO LONGER copy and paste txt etc from a website with HTML in it and have that HTML formatting show up in the pasted document into a Thunderbird Email.  What have you done with that function?  How do I fix it in about:config or other settings to get my functionality back and WHY have you removed the + from the new tab button.  Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous. Making Firefox less and less useful to the average user is NOT desirable behaviour. Pointless change for the sake of it?

My advice is: get rid of both and don't experiment by introducing new features without thoroughly investigating whether users are going to appreciate them  first.         Until this problem has been addressed, I'm going to install Google Chrome since I'll need to be certain that the connection is secure when using online banking sites."

A user should be able to make customization to a their needs. This new behavior has nothing to do with security and therefor should not be forced on a user. Perhaps to some it is an improvement.      I have used 'add to search bar'  as I am sure many user have.  We all know that little window is for searching, therefor we do not need a little icon to show that, What we all need to see is the icon of the search engine we select before we start typing in the box. After all    if I am searching for selenium powder I will start at Amazon, not wiki or yahoo.        Not seeing the icon causes another issue if you don't clear the window before you change search engines, an unintended search is automatically performed in the wrong place.      Also when you change the search engine How do you know it actually changed.    Consider a list of 18 places, you have to find the icon that is not shown in the group to know that is the one you are on. That really seems counter-intuitive.

Keeping open the tabs you'd like to have at your finger tips at any time and not be bothered by tabs from previous sessions. Either way.

The address bar functionality was near-flawless before...What is the purpose of making needless changes to it?         Now when you type a single character to get to the address in your history beginning with that letter that is visited most frequently, instead of the useful function of using the site header and presenting the address like any other entry in the browser's history, it now strips the site header AND the most visited link at a particular domain in favor of bold text that says ""Visit (Generic Domain Name)"". Stripping away one of the most useful functions of the program is inexplicable!        It may not even seem a significant change to a casual user, but for someone like me who has a carefully choreographed workflow that they've developed within the program over many years, it is so disruptive that I will be forced to downgrade and refuse future updates.

What initially attracted to me to the browser was how customizable it was. Having addons changed the way I browsed the internet. It was revolutionary.        Then things started pointlessly changing. Most noteworthy was taking away the search function from the URL bar way back when. I dealt with that by using the search bar more frequently. But then you changed the search bar to what it is now — a useless, cluttered mess that stripped away the browser's previously useable and pleasant search functionality.        I've fiddled with the about:config settings so much in the past few years that I can't even keep track of what I've done. Seems like I need to change something with every update.        Now, what I consider one of the final straws in making me seriously consider switching to Chrome, you've made this whole mess involving unsigned addons. You've taken away the one thing that brought me to Firefox in the first place. I've been a happy user for a long time now — almost 10 years — and now you're slowly turning what once was a respectable browser into a sinking ship.        I have no idea what you're thinking with these new updates. What does it take for Firefox's development team to realize they don't have to fix what isn't broken?

Up to     this version, Firefox would still honor the ""browser.search.showOneOffButtons""     which I used to keep the old style of search box.        I use many different search engines that have the same icon.  For example,     Wikipedia in 3 different languages.  The new interface requires hovering with     the mouse or using the up/down arrows to find the right one.  With a lot of     search engines configured, the name appears at the top instead of where your     are looking.  This requires looking up and down to see if the mouse cursor is     hovering the right one.        Also, stating in version 43, there is no way to keep the last used search     engine; it always goes back to the default.        I sincerely don't see how the icons are an improvement over the old list     interface.  The long list of previous searches has no value for me.  With the     old interface, Firefox would complete the characters typed with possible     matches.  Using the Down key, you could select previous searches or matches     and using ALT-Down would show the list of search engines.        I hope I manage to explain the issues sufficiently clearly to prevent this     from being just a pointless rant.  Firefox is my browser of choice and I hope     to keep it that way!"

You need to stop relying on Google for your income, and it wasn't doing them much good anyways. Now though, I can't autocomplete anymore without going down at least past the automatic ""yahoo search for goo"" to get to google, to do a google search. I'm sure (I pray) that there's an easier workflow here, but like I said, I'm lazy. I liked where you were for the past ~8 years and I don't like the hoops I have to jump through to get to a page that's in my mind but not in my search history or favorites.

I'd say it's more related to questions about why investments are being made in areas seen as purely cosmetic (Australis / the new notification slide-out) when there are (as far as I know) bugs a decade old still lurking in the code."

As I type further, for example by now typing ""Mi"", aka adding the letter ""i"", then a new priority list will drop down as suggested search terms, and I can now edit the priority of this new dropdown menu.

There are many users out there, including me, who find the new search bar (as of version 34 and up) very clunky, non-intuitive and slower to use than the previous version.        My main concerns with this new search system is that, unlike the old system, you don't have the ability to choose the engine PRIOR to entering a search query. This affects suggestions for search engines such as Wikipedia and Google, which generate completely different suggestions as they provide different types/forms of information. Having to switch engines through mouse clicks or sifting through your list with Ctrl/Cmd + Up/Down is just an extra step in searching, defeating the purpose of an integrated quick search bar to begin with!        Furthermore, I would prefer Firefox to leave the search bar set to the engine I last used. Since I switch between multiple search engines frequently, and make consecutive searches from this engine (though not enough to warrant setting a default engine) this feature is especially important. Additionally, showing the icon of the selected search engine instead of just a magnifying glass icon is much more efficient because at a glance, I know which engine I'm searching on.        With regards to the new search layout, the grid takes up more space than it needs to, especially if search suggestions are provided. I liked that the drop-down-list style of the old search bar leaves this space for suggestions, instead of search engine icons on top of suggestions. The less clutter I see on my screen, the better. Another reason I prefer the drop-down-list style of the search bar is that when selecting an engine, you see both the icon and the name of the search engine. For engines that have similar-looking icons (e.g. Urban Dictionary and Thesaurus), having the name helps me distinguish between the two at a glance so I know that I'm using the right search engine.

When using Firefox I block all cookies by default and add domains to the whitelist as needed. At some point this whitelist has become VERY particular about which domains it will and won't allow to set cookies - subdomains must be separately whitelisted or they will be blocked. In addition, it treats ""https://"" as separate from ""http://"", and cares about if the ""www"" is included or not. This makes what could be a fast and simple operation into an exercise in trial and error.    For example, recently I tried to log in to www.gog.gom after clearing all cookies and preferences. It used to be enough to simply whitelist ""gog.com"", but this no longer works. After considerable trial and error, to actually allow this site to use cookies requires whitelisting some combination of the following:        http://www.gog.com    https://www.gog.com    http://gog.com    https://gog.com    http://login.gog.com    https://login.gog.com        I would hope and expect that the whitelist would allow cookies from all subdomains of an entry, so that simply ""gog.com"" covered all of the variants listed above. Then it is up to the user to be specific if they want to be specific. Or very broad if they want that.        So in short it would be of great help and convenience if the following features existed in Firefox:        1) A way to tell Firefox to allow cookies from all subdomains and http/https variants of cookie whitelist entries. If there's some technical or security reason why that is unwise then perhaps have it configurable for each whitelist entry individually.        2) A fast way to ""allow cookies from this site"" using clicks, ideally in a new button that could be placed in a toolbar where the user wants it (if they want it).        3) Sort the whitelist alphabetically by the highest level domain. It currently sorts from left to right, which means that ""https://mozilla.org"" is nowhere near ""http://mozilla.org"" or ""https://input.mozilla.org"" on the list. this makes the list very difficult to deal with.

At that point, I start losing the ability to see comments at different websites such as Accuweathers FB plugin, or with Disqus  it might take 5 or 6 attempts at logging on before Disqus sees me. Recently, I have had to open a second page and then log on again to make Disqus recognize me. This is all harassment and attempts to silence my voice in the catastrophic climate change argument by good left wing Democrats. This has been going on for years, but I will not allow them to silence my voice. This has meant that over the years, I have to constantly delete my C: drive and reinstall my backup. Lately, I do this every several days. However, recently at Whats Up with That a friend who knows what I do not know mentioned obliquely that I should use Chrome. I figured that his comment was meant for me so I tried Chrome after deleting Firefox and found that my user profile was no longer steadily be added to.

In the drop down menu with the text it was clear what to select.    - when I switch the search engine it will send the text from the last search to the new selected search engine. That could result in sending data to a search engine where this that data should have never been send to.    - In version 42.0 I was able to select the search engine I want to use for the next searches. Now that is not possible any more. I often use a search engine several times in a row and then another search engine several times in a row. Now I have to select another search engine every single time I do not want to use the standard search engine. In version 42.0 I was able to select a search engine in the dropdown and then I was able to use Right Click - Search with X. Now I have to go to the settings menu every time I want to switch the search engine. The drop down was much easier and faster.

With OneOffButton, I have to:    use Ctrl-K to input the search term, then, use mouse, or UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT buttons to select the search engine, which is very complicated and time costing.         This was why I set browser.search.showOneOffButtons to false and still using the old search style.

FireFox used to be slicker than oiled PVC but for the past 2 or 3 months it's OK (not great, but OK) when it starts but gradually gets slower & slower until I have to restart it. It's not the websites (waiting for google? come on guys...), the PC or my service. I can sit IE alongside on my screen, accessing the same websites over the same cable & get completely normal response times.    I think the problem may be something to do with threading - it doesn't seem to be working right.    Symptoms are:    let's say I'm googling ""Fred Bloggs""    as soon as I enter ""Fred"" google lists some Freds I might have been asking about but wasn't (Astaire, Olsen Cruise Lines, etc)    at this point FireFox freezes; I can carry on typing ""Bloggs"" but the new text doesn't appear on the query box; I can't switch to a different tab in FireFox but other programs continue behaving as normal, so it's not something like running out of memory    after a **long** time (up to a minute, not a couple of seconds) the extra text (""Bloggs"") appears in the query box, google posts a list of websites & normal service is resumed, though with the same very slow response    if I exit FireFox & restart it again it will be OK for a few minutes, then it will slow down again    I'd emphasise that IE, running alongside, behaves perfectly normally.    FYI, I'm running Win 7 (up to date) on a quad core AMD, 8Gb RAM, elderly but adequate XFX/Nvidia graphics card etc, all standard stuff. The Internet connection is cable broadband, guaranteed 20Mbps (but does sometimes slip below that) & generally seems to run at around 50 - 100Mbps. I run WinZip System Utilities every week to defrag the disc, tidy up the registry etc, & I have F-secure Safe malware protection, which claims I'm free of viruses etc.    Thoughts"

It has been my browser of choice for many years, and any experiment with a different browser left me unsatisfied.        Firefox has seen some radical UI changes over the years. I initially disagreed with many of them, but mostly, they did not take much getting used to because the general workflow was not affected significantly.        This, unfortunately, cannot be said about the complete removal of the old search bar that has been put in place recently. The new search does NOT improve the workflow - on the contrary, it complicates things at every level. Entering repeated searches into the same search engine (e.g., a translator - a very widespread use case) now involves pointing the mouse to the desired search engine after *every* single search request. This alone slows down the process considerably, compared to simply terminating your search request with <return>.        And then there is the problem of locating the correct search engine, because the new search bar displays only icons and no description. For example, can you tell the difference between the English and German Wikipedia in the screenshot (see link below)? Bet you can't. You have to hover over all the potential targets, one by one, and then choose the right one based on the tooltips. How can the developers fail to realise that this is *highly* impractical? The new search bar has added not one, but *two* time-consuming, counterintuitive and utterly unnecessary steps to a formerly simple and straight-forward workflow. I have yet to identify a situation where the new search provides a significant improvement over the old one. (The ""solution"" offered by a developer to temporarily change the default search engine via the <ctrl> and arrow keys - i.e., cycling through a long list of search engines one by one - misses the point entirely.)        And now, we can't even choose the old search via the showOneOffButtons flag in about:config. It has been removed despite widespread criticism. Joe Average probably doesn't care, but your slightly more experienced users do. I can't help but feel angry that this group of users is, apparently, ignored. Microsoft couldn't have done it better.        It would be a nice Christmas present to bring back the old search bar.        Thank you and happy Christmas,        Dominic"

If you don't recognize what drew people to Firefox in the first place, they will just abandon it.        For what it's worth, I don't mind paying $30 or whatever to turn Firefox into ""normal"" software that stays out of my way.

I use you because as a free, open source software, I hope that your mission will keep you dedicated to serving the end user. But lately, you're doing stuff that I'm not asking you to do and making my life difficult.         I don't like opening my browser to discover the latest automatic update has disabled my favorite add-ons. That's not cool. I use those for important functions and now you're telling me I have to go deep into the configuration settings to undo this? That's really not user friendly at all.        And then you're doing this thing where you're putting ads for your own product INSIDE YOUR PRODUCT. That's super not cool. I can't see ads. It's not just that I don't like them, I have ADHD and anxiety and my job as a researcher requires me to be able to focus deeply. Ads interrupt my work and my life so intensely that it can take me days to recover from their effects. I have no facebook, no tv, no twitter, no newsfeeds, all of this because ads are such a huge problem for me. So why is my browser forcing me to see ads for itself? That is super uncool on an unfathomable level.        I really hoped that you might be immune to the corporate nonsense that makes chrome, safari and whatever browser windows is tooting right now so maddeningly frustrating to use, but lately you're going in their direction. You're basically making your product a heavier, slower version of chrome without the immediate smartphone compatibility. Why would you do that?        Please stop letting me down. Please remember your roots and bring your product back to the amazing thing it was ten years ago, or maybe even just three years ago. But whatever you do, please stop getting unawesome like you're doing now.        Thanks        (me)"

However, when I upgraded Firefox this morning to 43.0.1, all Kaspersky add-ons have for some reason been disabled, with absolutely no way way of turning them back on again or finding proper updates.

Surely Firefox has open communication channels with the major security providers (Kaspersky, Bit Defender, McAfee and Panda) in order to ensure that any add-ons provided by those products are compatible with any updates produced by Firefox?

Only after I installed the latest version was I told that three of my most useful add-ons were disabled. Maybe the developers of those add-ons haven't updated them yet, but it seems Firefox could have scanned my existing version and offered me the option of whether to continue the installation. Instead, at my significant inconvenience, I now have to search for alternatives.    2. Both the previous Firefox version and the latest version do NOT load the reader comments to articles on the Salon.com website. This is also a problem with other websites too numerous to list here. If Firefox can't fix this, I'm going to have to use Safari as my preferred browser. I'm on a unibody Macbook running Mavericks with 8 gigs of RAM.

It was pure horror show (does MS NOT have a UI team ??? lol :)) , but at least it worked properly ; sadly also proving that it was again Nightly , and not the huge amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday traffic .  Sigh .          2. Add to that the session crashes often after a slow spell ( it got to the point where I could accurately say , "" This is gonna be a crash. ""  And lately the crash bug submit box has not been popping up afterward every time.  That's when I know I have to 'shutdown -f -r now' enter... Dammit.  Up back back back -t 1 enter . Sigh.  Just can't bring myself to Win+D Alt+F4 R Enter lol :))    NOTE: I know the system instability after such a crash is the 'Windows Feature' of poor memory management.  Suddenly Nightly and resulting calls and sockets and paged and non paged memory go *poof* and so a couple svchost go belly up and have to reload, then time out and do the same... *bigger sigh* ... I have been dealing with THAT for three decades of professional IT experience lol :))        3. And finally , because disabling e10 has solved the issues , ( Dunno why I didn't think of that before...  Oh yeah... I always start troubleshooting at the wrong end... "" DD Marcus at the Cleveland office can't get his email . ""    "" OK. I'm gonna check our routing tables here real quick . You go pull up his latest image off the server and have someone get me Erik at Level 3 ""     "" Hey sally said he just called back and said the thing that looks like a big phone cord wasn't plugged in . ""  :)) ) ,     I can stop doing all kinds of tests ... stuff ... things , and worry about that next year lol :))        Happy Holiday of your choice or not choice or whatever lol :))        Cheers all !!!

If I type a character's name into my search bar, it used to take me to their tumblr tag, no fuss. But now it takes me to RP blogs that I clicked on maybe once that have the same name as that character instead, so there's something off with whatever you use to calculate how often I use that tag.     Or, if I go to my preferred fanfiction site, instead of the first result being the character language and pairings settings that I've used without issue prior, it offers me the main website itself which is not what I want. Again, I've visited the link that has the preferred filters WAY more than the main website link itself. I'm already using that website and I don't need to be reminded of the main page.

At least allow me to refuse the update with prior knowledge, or better allopw me to decide if i still want to use the add ons and allow me to asses the risk.    But to add insult to injury you expect us to contact the suppliers of the add ons to force an them to comply to your needs or payments or conditions or what ever the problems is.

YouTube is the site where these things are happeing at and I hope to fuck that you haven't reliquished authority over to them/anyone else to be able to do what they like with their site user's computer - no one should be given such rights and other chrome browsers could ensure that for the user and you should put controls in for that to happen in firefox too but only in every version update ever brought out! TAB REFRESHING IS ALSO A PROBLEM OF BEING DENIED IT AND SUBSCRIBING/UNSUBSCRIBING IS THE LATEST PROBLEM TO BE ACTING INTERMITENT AND THE WORST ONE IS GETTING WHO I WANT ON MY HOMEPAGE ON MY HOMEPAGE AND THE AMOUNT OF THOSE THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THE PAGE HAS STEADILY BEEN REDUCED = MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE A YOUTUBE HOMEPAGE/USER CHOICE/POSSIBLY EVEN YOUTUBE/GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!"

Previously, it was immediately obvious which was which.        Depending on which OS I'm using, the following allowed me to to switch search engines within seconds:         command/control-L         tab         option/alt-down_arrow         (the first letter of the search engine)        So on OSX, command-l, tab, option-down, ""g"" would select google... ""i"" would select IMDB.        This is now broken, replaced by something MUCH slower, which requires more thought and effort.        Honestly, I understand that most users are clueless and I understand some might need ""training wheels"".  But while training wheels may be appropriate for beginners, with bicycles they are easily removed when they're no longer needed or appropriate.  The equivalent should apply here.        Just to be clear, I really HATE this change.  And while I now recall something about some tweak related to localization or something, I'm annoyed that I have to keep fixing this crap whenever a new update comes out and breaks things.        Honestly, I do appreciate all the work that the developers are doing.  Firefox, when extended with Tab Mix Plus, All In One Sidebar, No Script, and Flashblock still provides me the most compelling power-user browsing experience I have found.        The problem is that over the last few years a trend in software has emerged where more and more of the software I use has been dumbed-down or changed in ways that make it less productive or completely useless to me.  When it's something as important to me as Firefox is, it touches a nerve."

But the pressure from Microsoft to change-up was enormous, especially with Microsoft sabotaging the software support market for XP. I would like to note that the only one supporting XP was Firefox that allowed me to quickly browse where Microsoft Explorer did not (slow and unresponsive).       Therefore, I now own one of the latest computers: I7 Intel Processor 6th Generation Quad Core 64Bit, etc. and I am Firefox loyal and have set it as my default browser. It has always been quick to launch and incredibly reliable but of late it seems to hang and has radically slowed down in performance. It seems as if I'm always waiting for it to load    or perform the next function. At this point I would like to reiterate that it has never done this previously on my new computer system.     I should also inform you that I have done the latest update and I am using ""43.0.1""  and I also have on my computer system Microsoft Edge for Windows 10. I have recently launched ""Edge"" to see if there is any problem with it as far as hanging and being unresponsive at times, and instead it is quick and immediately very responsive. However, I hate the format and dislike using it, due to my aversion of anything Microsoft. I prefer to use ""Firefox,"" but its performance, as I have previously stated, is beginning to become frustrating: It seems comparatively speaking to previous performance to be hanging, slow and unresponsive.  I would like you if you can to remedy this and I really want to continue to use  ""Firefox"" as my default browser!    I would also like to state for the record that I'm not a ""paranoid"" person but I wouldn't be surprised if in some way Microsoft has figured out a way through Microsoft 10 to create an incompatibility with ""Firefox"" which acts to create    a hanging, slowing, and unresponsiveness.

It is apparently a very rare condition!        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1066223    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1128127    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1187065        I do have Adblock Plus installed and I have tried with it disabled.            What happens:        Click the Ghostery Icon and select the blue button with the cog wheel icon. Once you have clicked that a sub-menu item will be displayed. Click the Options button to the left. A new Tab will open and a blank page is displayed with the URL: resource://firefox-at-ghostery-dot-com/ghostery/data/options.html        Expected to happen:        Click the Ghostery Icon and select the blue button with the cog wheel icon. Once you have clicked that a sub-menu item will be displayed. Click the Options button to the left. A new Tab will open and a NON blank page with the Options set out is displayed with the URL: resource://firefox-at-ghostery-dot-com/ghostery/data/options.html        //---        Since the latest update (v43.0.1) only a blank options page is getting displayed.

I realize that it may very well be prudent to require add-no signing for Firefox users who are not adept at computers. But Mozilla would be very wise to continue to allow experienced users to override enforcement of add-on signing. Enforcing signing would kill off 10 add-ons that make my Firefox experience more efficient and pleasurable. Even the Adobe Acrobat DC add-on does not pass the signing test. Classic Theme Restorer also fails -- and without those two I will have to discontinue using Firefox. I vastly prefer Firefox and recommend Firefox to all my clients for whom I build computers.        Given that Firefox usage continues to slide, I would like to suggest that the decision to eliminate the override of add-on signing will only cost Mozilla more Firefox users. I strongly urge you to allow the override to continue indefinitely so that experienced Firefox users can continue to use the add-ons that make Firefox their browser of choice.

Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document.

View my list WITHOUT needing to change the page to a rather clunky and difficult-to-load archive,    2. Know if I had previously ""marked"" a page (with the red highlight of the pocket button) , without needing to go to my list and check manually,    3. Remove a page from the saved page itself, by clicking the already-colored pocket button itself (""toggling"" it).    I feel like these issues can be easily fixed in further updates.

The last 26+ days at least I can NO LONGER copy and paste txt etc from a website with HTML in it and have that HTML formatting show up in the pasted document into a Thunderbird Email.  What have you done with that function?  How do I fix it in about:config or other settings to get my functionality back and WHY have you removed the + from the new tab button.  Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous. Making Firefox less and less useful to the average user is NOT desirable behaviour. Pointless change for the sake of it?

Why not immediately this text window?        Got FF 43.0.1 (on Mac OS 10.10.4).         Some feedbacks for further improvements:        1) BOOKMARKS TOOLBAR    I have folders in the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"".     Normally (in all previous versions), when click ONE time on the folder icon (in Bookmakrs Toolbar, just above the inner browser window), all the entries were shown in a popup-menu and they stayed open to select an entry. Now in version 43.0.1 the popup-menu does not stay open. Instead, Firefox selects immediately one bookmark from this popup (probably the first entry). To overcome this problem, when you then click-hold on folder-icom and then try to move the cursor on a bookmark, it drags and moves the folder icon!! Very annoying !! Practically impossible to use the Bookmarks Toolbar anymore !!!!!    Please put it back like it was in version 42!        2) PAGE BOOKMARKED    Since a long time it is bad and is still: the ""Page Bookmarked"" window to save a bookmarks is such a un-handy thing. It would be great if it's possible to change it's width. With  Edit Bookmark Plus 2.3.2 I am at least able to change it's length.        3) BOOKMARK LIBRARY    – when copying one or several selected link entries: it would be great if it would copy NAME and URL, tab & return separated ! (still this version only copies the URLs),    – to copy a selected folder including its content from the Library sidebar (inc. NAME + URL like described above),    – to change the NAME right in the entry, without the need to go down in the 3 lines ""Name, Location, Tags"",        4) KEY COMMANDS    – develop and implement a tool in Firefox, which allows users to define and edit their own key commands !        Thanks for consideration !!        Best, Thomas"

I am glad that I can restore this functionality with the 'Classic Theme Restorer' add-on, but I would ask you, pretty please, that in future versions of Firefox, you let your Users chose how they wish to configure the browser instead of just taking things away from them without warning.

So when you get used to how something works Like Windows, and Firefox you try to go hipster with it and mess it all up. Thus literally pissing off millions (Several of my family Members) who just finally figured out how to use and what is where on Firefox, As of the Layout. Thus why so many use Classic Theme Restorer. Who's bright Idea was to place the tabs above the address bar is insane. Be Yourself stop trying to copy others.         2nd issue I configure my Firefox for quickness and ergonomics. So the ability to arrange Firefox is so I can access and paste various information and web sites at a drop of a dime. So what is the Issue?  The ability to arrange context menus/ tab menus to ones needs. I should not have to scroll to the to the bottom of menu copy tab url or name. Here is the thought process If I am copying the Link I must be going to paste it right after. Question is why don't Firefox have a built in Menu editor already? There are add-on I use that load menu options I really don't use on menu = Clutter  Or why is spell check near bottom of context menu ? Just as people have the ability to arrange their toolbars to their liking adding the features they need why not the the drop down menus?  I find it odd that the Options for Firefox is down near bottom of menu than near top on the Tools menu. Use and Importance. Much of the menus are arranged by first added last added.         As screen captured         http://prntscr.com/9gs08m        Is it going to kill me/ No by it is a daily nuisance.         So why not add a Menu Editor Tab to Options. Many other add-ons like Tab Mix Plus allows users to add the options they want. With the Menu Editor ( Menu Bar File/Edit/View..., Menu context, and Tab Menu ) the ability to hide menu items and drag and drop order arrange features)"

Until now, there has been a simple method to return to the older style search bar, but with Firefox 43, this method no longer works.        See this article for more details:    http://www.ghacks.net/2015/12/16/how-to-restore-classic-search-in-firefox-43/        As noted in the article, it is possible to use the ""Classic Theme Restorer"" add-on to bring back the old search interface, but this is not an ideal solution. Firefox needs to provide a solution that allows users to search the web quickly and securely.        The new search bar has two major problems:        * Searching requires unnecessary page loads. The user enters their search term, Firefox submits it to the default search provider (not the one the user wants!), then the user selects the search provider, and the search is performed again. This is a waste of time and bandwidth.        * There is a potential breach of privacy. Since the current search engine is not displayed until after the search is initiated, if a user is searching for a sensitive topic, their search term may be sent somewhere they did not intend it to go.        The old-style search was a perfect solution, and it was the main reason I used Firefox as my preferred browser for so long. I'm not completely against change, but the new search interface is just broken. I will use ""Classic Theme Restorer"" add-on for now, but I really hope someone at Firefox takes note of these problems, and initiates an effort to fix them."

If I save a new bookmark, it doesn't show up. Only in ""recently added"". Make the bookmarks work as they do in IE or Chrome. There is too much work involved to manage bookmarks. Bookmarks have an icon associated with them that get deleted when I re-boot my computer.    I had to disable an Ad-On because it drastically slowed the browser as if it was tracking me and sending out my browsing history to millions of un-named 3rd parties.    Firefox blocks images in some of my emails. I have to use the dreaded IE to see what Ebay has suggested for me.    Otherwise, I love it. It is very fast. Web pages don't load at dial-up speeds anymore. I don't get error messages asking me to stop slow running Java Scripts. The scroll bars are never locked until ads & videos are completely loaded first before any content of interest. The tabs and browser can be closed at any time. They aren't hijacked & disabled by rouge websites. I don't have to open Task Manager anymore to force the browser to close and get logged out of any site that I was visiting because my browser was allowed to be taken over by a website. I don't see ads related to my browsing history from other sites while browsing IN PRIVATE as was the case with the new Edge browser. Opening another tab does not disable all other tabs until all advertisements & videos are loaded first, or locks up as with Edge. Edge has little support to view PDF documents. It is the biggest piece of spyware on the planet next to Windows 10. Chrome was faster, but shared some of the same problems as IE. I don't like logging in to Google to get access to my bookmarks. They can better track you that way. I don't get 199 tracking cookies for my Internet Eraser to delete when I close the browser. It took about 3 days of use before I made Firefox my default browser. Yahoo locked up all of the time and is extremely slow with all of the flash ads and videos it downloads as top priority over content. Now, Yahoo is fast when using Firefox. You don't use up you bandwidth limits for the month viewing just one website anymore. The ads are still visible too. The browser is responsive and doesn't slow or lock up like Edge or IE. I give Firefox a 5 star rating. If they simplify the bookmark management, I'll give it 6 to 7 stars out of a maximum of 5 stars."

I live in Colorado, I don't need an airport page to order food! But your new, awful, ""Search With"" autopopulating waste of electrons has made years (hell, pretty much a decade) of muscle memory useless and annoying. I don't use products that make an integral part of me useless and annoying. Thankfully, after much more searching than I should have had to do, I found a developer article on setting browser.urlbar.unifiedcomplete to false. Once I did this, the Firefox I know and love returned to me and we joined hands and skipped happily to all the open and joyous fields the internet has to provide. If you are going to change something an integral as how the location bar works with an annoying and truly awful feature, please make the ability to turn is off explicit somewhere in preferences. For everyone one person like myself that is set in their ways enough to hate this and yet  saavy enough to fix it, there are likely thousands who will just switch browsers rather than be annoyed, dig for hours to fix it and then write pissy feedback."

I do wish that when you release a new version that you would have your act together and have put out information to the developers instead of telling the user that it is our problem.

Please advise if there is some Firefox setting I can use to stop this cross program data sharing. My preference would be to lock up the session data so another program can't find it. Don't know if this has to do with cookies, local storage, or what, but I am concerned. Avast may be trustworthy but the next guy won't be. Seems to me this could happen in the background and one would never know what Yahoo emails would be sent or Facebook postings made."

Is it unreasonable to expect a function that has worked flawlessly for YEARS to KEEP working? Why is it so hard to RETURN functionality that has been in Firefox for YEARS?  Same Same as previously. Listen to feedback?????? The last 26+ days at least I can NO LONGER copy and paste txt etc from a website with HTML in it and have that HTML formatting show up in the pasted document into a Thunderbird Email.  What have you done with that function?  How do I fix it in about:config or other settings to get my functionality back and WHY have you removed the + from the new tab button.  Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous. Making Firefox less and less useful to the average user is NOT desirable behaviour. Pointless change for the sake of it?

And then came Opera 13, which was based on Chromium; EVERYTHING good about that browser had lost.        I plan to start using Vivaldi browser when it will finally be released, but I'm afraid I'll lose the potential of the Firefox add-ons (as I said, I don't use any fancy customization and as of writing the only add-on I have installed is AdBlock Plus, but it's never too late).        Vivaldi is based on Chromium and it means one thing: it's depending on Google.        WebExtensions is a good idea of implementing a more modern extensions API, but it also means becoming more like Google Chrome; I fear that when the time will come, Firefox will lose many of it's add-ons API features and things that were possible with the previous system will not be possible any more.        Please focus your resources on making the best add-ons API you can make, greatly improving Project Electrolysis, improving Web standards support, making optimizations but most importantly:    Making the browser more customizable and appealing for power-users.    If you'll do that, I am certainly sure Firefox' market share will GREATLY INCREASE, and Mozilla will have a brighter future."

I can't help but wonder if Mozilla is being deliberately sabotaged by people who hate Firefox. It's becoming that awful.

I'll start by stating that this isn't about aversion to change. Many who frequently use the search bar will have a problem with the new search bar. The design flaw is very real; it adds to the number of necessary operations. That's a big no-no, unless the entire purpose of the product is aesthetic. I presume that isn't Mozilla's intention with Firefox.        Specifically:        Before: Put hand on mouse, click search bar, select engine, take hand off mouse, type search term, hit return.    Now: Put hand on mouse, click search bar, take hand off mouse, type search term, put hand on mouse, click search bar, select search engine.        Of these operations, the movement between keyboard and mouse is the most significant. It's also the one you have added with this change.        Making it worse:        I use many search engines, but the main predictor of my next search, is the previous search. Consequently, I want the last search engine chosen to be the default for new searches. This saved many operations on the old search bar. The new search bar makes it a clumsy procedure.        Also, among my many search engines are ones without logo, with similar logos, and with identical logos. The texted name of the engine really was necessary."

Or rather, turn off the override that allowed the old functionality? Since v34 I've used the browser.search.showOneOffButtons=true option to keep the functionality of the box. I really liked the way it worked in the past! In fact it's part of why I still use Firefox as my default browser. Normally I have the search set to Google, and I can see the Google icon there and know that when I search for something I'm going to get Google results. But if I'm wanting to buy some stuff on Amazon, I drop it down to Amazon for a while. Same for eBay or Wikipedia - I switch the box based on what I'm currently working on. Most importantly, I have the visual of the icon, so when I'm about to search for something again, I know if I need to switch it back. I can go about my business without having to stop and think about the interface. Now that the override no longer works, I basically have to stop, look and think EVERY TIME I want to do a search, because I don't necessarily remember where I left it. Sure, I can pretty easily change the default with a click, point, right-click operation (still a lot more trouble than a single click-select), but it's the ""stop and think because there's no visual cue"" that is really messing up my established workflow. The interface should, in my opinion, ""just work"" without me having to stop and think about how it's working. That leaves me more brain power for the actual task at hand (i.e. figuring out what to search for and then reviewing the results). I'm going back to v42. If I hear that this has been fixed, I'll start updating again. Thanks!        BTW, I do really like having a search box, and the fact that other browsers have gone more to ""search from the URL box"" is another reason I remain with Firefox. If I want to type a URL, I put it in the URL box. If I want to search, I use the search box. Maybe that's old fashioned, but I prefer to work that way."

I understand how to disable the check but being permitted (or forced) to do that only globally, rather than for one specific plug-in, is security-weakening, not security-improving, especially when the plug-in uses its own validation methods in conjunction with this base package.        This is not a theoretical issue.  I don't know about others, but the signature requirement has disabled the plug-in that allows recent commercial, ""Pro"", versions of Adobe Acrobat to assemble copies of web pages into PDF files.  Adobe is aware of the problem but seems to be proceeding slowly, I assume because of their own multi-platform production and commit processes.        Before they get a signed version posted, you have essentially put me -- and, I assume, a very large number of other Acrobat users -- into a position where we have little choice other than going to other browsers when we need those Acrobat services.  Of, of course, we can freeze at 42.x or earlier, but that prevents us from installing security and other upgrades to the base browser.  Neither option benefits either the user nor Mozilla.        I think Firefox is badly in need of a reasonably easy-to-use mechanism for disabling the signature requirement on a per-plug-in basis.  Put whatever warnings in front of that which you like.  Warn people about it every time Firefox is upgraded (or even started) if you think that is appropriate.  But making it impossible to use a particular plug-in that doesn't conform to your signature standards sets you up as the protocol or security police, appears to me to violate Open Source principles, and is generally unwise, especially when it seems to me that you are already walking a fine line by favoring some commercial products over others (e.g., by switching everyone to Yahoo! as the default search engine when they upgraded).

For those using screenreaders, there is an extension called Webvisum which assists us in solving captchas, without which we're unable to perform essential services on websites, especially those which have not implemented an audio or similar alternative. The software is not being maintained & therefore is not digitally signed. While your adherence to digital signatures is commendable, there really should be an override, as I now find myself having to revert to a previous version of Firefox in order to use this extension. Other blind people are similarly situated. So it seems like Mozilla is quite willing to compromise the security of users who need or want a particular extension as opposed to simply allowing for an override. That does not seem quite fair, & indeed, from my viewpoint, it seems to go against what Mozilla stands for. It'd be good if you'd treat your users as though they're not stupid. Let us make the decision as to whether our need or desire for a particular add-on is a security risk. Warn us--yes--but don't shove it down our throats. There are exceptions to everything, & I'd think approving an individual extension with an understanding of the risks is a far better security alternative than reverting to an old version w/updates disabled in order to be able to use the desired addon."

I then have to begin the arduous and infuriatingly time consuming process of looking through folder after folder to locate it.  It used to be so easy.

Now I seem to be only able to search with the first engine in my list.          I've been mocked by my friends for continuing to use Firefox and I defended my preference with this feature which doesn't exist on other browsers, and I used it frequently.           The lack of continued support for the browser.search.showOneOffButtons feature will change the way I use the internet in a negative way.

This is from a clean install and no 3rd party extensions (as you will see from the technical data that is attached to this report).         Using Windows 7 SP1 with computer up to date, no malware, no viruses, I thought it was a windows issue. Tried to troubleshoot all day blaming the computer, firewall, antivirus, windows and none of it was the problem, the problem was the upgrade from Firefox 43.0.2, that breaks the functionality. I mean everything!! Cannot send a health report, check status, check add-ons, load any webpages. The only menu that works is ""troubleshooting information"". Everything else is broken.         As soon as I reverted back to 43.0.1 download from your FTP page the browser works again, when I upgrade or do a fresh install of 43.0.2 it stops working, and all beta releases past 43.0.2 do not work either on the computer. Can you please look into this. Thank You!!!"

I expect this came from a lot of youtube videos that I watched with html5- But I can not confirm this yet- I just switched back to flash video and I will see!    Anyway this was not the reason for the problem which made me care about this memoryconsumption- It was the fact that I could not save the session with sessionmanager anymore!    I tried then to find out if a limit was reached and closed so many tabs that I had same nr. again as in the last session that I saved- But I could still not save it! so I closed FF and restarted and the problem is gone now!        But another issue keeps me feel very bad: It is that FF (and I know this issue since so long time but nothing changes) interupts my workflow no matter what I do- if I type or if I write: I must wait until it reacts again!    My session has now already 1400tabs and I am happy that it works finally after so long time of waiting until you made the new FF in which the addons work properly together that I need so much!        At next  turned off the duplicate tabs closer addon but the problem still persists!    I hear the harddisk work so much also all the time! FF is a stupid program!    Why don´t you make it more intelligent? Maybe because the software cant be cleverer than its developers... :(    I mean : To save a session you do not need to write the whole session again and again and again!    You need to add one site only each time when I open one!    so it needs much less work on the harddisk and much less CPU power too!        I can imgine it might be one of the addons auto unload tab or check4changes!    But this fugking addons are not restartless addons! It is not nice to test if this is the case!    You are no good softwaredvelopers- you have the good ideas- but you have no knowledge I think!    Why else did you need 40versions to bring it to this one here?    If I could start FF in multiple instances it would help also! Then I would not need to worry to close all windows at once if I click on close!  - I know I can close single windows of my sessions but to keep  the session in good saved condition it is not easy! A lot of actions I can do, have effect at all windows!        But that my harddisk is working allllll the time is unacceptable! Do you work iwth the hardwareindustry?    so I need a new harddisk earlier?    I wish you to get what you deserve for this!

Why can you not return a simple function? Is it unreasonable to expect a function that has worked flawlessly for YEARS to KEEP working? Why is it so hard to RETURN functionality that has been in Firefox for YEARS?  Same Same as previously. Listen to feedback?????? The last 28+ days at least I can NO LONGER copy and paste txt etc from a website with HTML in it and have that HTML formatting show up in the pasted document into a Thunderbird Email.  What have you done with that function?  How do I fix it in about:config or other settings to get my functionality back and WHY have you removed the + from the new tab button.  Both Still present in earlier versions. WHY remove these things and if you want to change the BASE function that has been there forever why not give the user the OPTION to put it back how it was?????        When you take away functionality from something as fundamental as copy and paste you must expect queries on how to return and FIX the problems you just created for a function that has been there for multi years.  Surely it's NOT unreasonable to be able to copy material from a web site with all the attendant embedded links and formatting and paste it into say a word or other type of document. Why would you remove such a function???        Virtually EVERYDAY you take something AWAY.  It's getting beyond ridiculous. Making Firefox less and less useful to the average user is NOT desirable behaviour. Pointless change for the sake of it?        This block has links in it and I USED to be able to post them into Mozilla Thunderbird. You took that away. Why and for what??

It's absolutely incredible that there's no way to access one or the other with a single click. I have 4 different icons on my toolbar to that effect, and they still don't do the job (Bookmark this Page, Show your Bookmarks, Show your History and Show Sidebars). Not only do they overlap, but each of them has a different user interface logic. And that's a customised interface, not the default one.        The result is I never know where to click when I want to do something bookmark or history-related.        What's required (and that other browsers have been providing for, what ? a decade ?) is :        1. One click, and I'm presented with the full folder structure of my bookmarks, in a stable and workable window (not nested menus popping up unexpectedly all over the place). That could be on the left pane, à la Windows Explorer, which is a true and tried convention that everybody understands ; or it could be splashed over a full tab, following a more modern convention.        2. One click, and I'm presented with my full history, with calendar help. Again, it could be on the left pane, in a tab or elsewhere, but a in big, fixed working space.        3. Optionally, if commands 1 and 2 don't give access to all relevant functions, a one-click access to the full-fledged management of bookmarks and history (the equivalent of the Library window).  1 and 2 would be for browsing, bookmarking pages and quick file management on the fly, and 3 would be for more thorough file management, search, backup, etc.        Of course, you should be able to switch in one click between 1, 2 and 3, wherever you are and wherever you want to go. It's absolutely incredible, for instance, that when I'm in Bookmarks (left pane), there's no link to go from there to the Library (which is just an expansion of Bookmarks). It has already taken me 2 clicks to get there, and now I have to back off from that area of the screen, climb again to the toolbar, guess the appropriate icon, and click again... twice ! Either Show your Bookmarks / Show all Bookmarks, or Show your History / Show all History.        The fact that there are multiple paths for the same effect increases the confusion. The wording of commands is deceptive. Show all Bookmarks doesn't do that at all, because the lesser option, Show Sidebars / Bookmarks, already shows all bookmarks in the left pane. What's specific in the Show all Bookmarks windows (Library) is that you can manage your bookmarks to the max -- and your history, which means that you should not have a different wording for Show all Bookmarks and Show all History, because they point to the same window (Library), only with a different folder pre-selected.        A better wording would be, for instance : Bookmarks / History / Manage Bookmarks and History.        By the way, you click into Show all Bookmarks, and a window opens which is called... Library ! How intuitive is that ?    When you click on Show your Bookmarks, the expanded option Show all Bookmarks is near the top of the drop-down menu (and also on the bottom : confusion, again !). But when you click on the (very similar) icon Show your History, in order to get to the expanded option Show all History, you have to go down to the bottom of the menu ! Not one thing is consistent, in that interface !        I know there are keyboard shortcuts, but that's an acquired taste, and their use shouldn't be compulsory.        I have chosen to hide menus, because they don't provide the solution and add to the confusion. The address bar does a great guessing job by mining the data in Bookmarks and History, but you can't rely only on that, and in order for it to find a bookmark, you have to file it first (and maintain the file system).        There might be extensions relevant to this issue (I've found a single one, it's clunky, and it solves one tiny part of the problem), but this is something that the barebones browser should provide out of the box."

The best thing Fire Fox did was to make Flash turned off by default. This helps a lot, especially since much advertising is flash based, and it was the adds that were primarily killing Fire Fox.

Hoping xkit would update, or firefox would soon update and happen to be compatible. I'm not fond of Chrome, and no way am I going back to Internet Explorer. BUT lately Firefox has been freezing almost every minute. Not for too long, and not too bad but it's become frustrating to type, or just simply scroll through a website. At first I thought it was still tumblr, but after exiting the tumblr tab I discovered it's just happening to the browser regardless.         I wish could provide you more info to fix it, but firefox worked before. Hoping maybe downgrading will work, if not maybe I'll bear the burden of Chrome until ya'll update again."

It is my default browser. Edge is the slowest browser & the easiest to be hijacked, lock-up or compromise your privacy/security. I've had this happen numerous times & sent feedback. I visited websites that displayed ads & items I just viewed from sites previously visited while browsing ""IN PRIVATE"". PDF support is awful too.    I couldn't access my bookmarks in Chrome unless I log-in to Google first. It doesn't respect privacy and let's you know this by plastering thumbnails of every website that you visited across the browser.     I have suggestions on how to improve Firefox. This is the only avenue I could find to do so since there is no ""Send Feedback"" link on the browser. The bookmark operation should be changed. I can't save new bookmarks. My bookmarks keep getting sorted in alphabetical order. I can't delete unused bookmarks. I learned that the bookmarks are a write protected file. That is the default setting. I read the procedure to unlock it, but it is too lengthy, complicated & confusing. Locked bookmarks should not be the default setting. I left the bookmarks alone and have to live without adding new ones until a new version appears to correct this. They show up in ""Recently Bookmarked"", but they eventually disappear while others that I never bookmarked appear & replace them. I liked the way IE Favorites worked. It was simple to use & manage. A suggestion for a new feature is to prevent websites from viewing your bookmarks. Bookmarks should be ""Read Protected"".  This is an invasion of privacy. I don't know them or want them to profile me. That's not their business. I don't have access to any of their personal information, why should they have access to mine. I would like to see bookmark access denied unless it allowed by the user. Also, the icon adjacent to bookmarks gets deleted when the computer is re-booted. Not good.    I visit Yahoo News and send articles of interest to open in new tabs to be read later. Edge used to slow down & lock up doing this. Firefox is very fast & stable. One thing that has happened is; sometimes a new pop-up window is opened playing a video ad. I didn't know this until I heard sound from my speakers. One time, several tabs were opened doing the same thing. I'm sure this new generation Pop-Up can be blocked. It is an unwanted nuisance.    One more item. When I read my email from Ebay, the suggested items are blocked & can't be viewed. There should be an option to ""View All Images"". I have to read this email in IE to see the image suggestions."

Anyone who runs a company that forces products that Don't Work on customers and expects nothing to come of it is either clinically insane, or chemically unbalanced well beyond anything Cortney Love or Jim Morrison considered reasonable.    No, really.    Do YOU people ever deal with your plugin container? Do YOU people ever go to Your Own plugin update page, update everything to only see that Your Own Page says you still need to update? Have YOU people ever tried to communicate with anyone at MozFf Through Your Own Website?    Yes, I know--It's the Holiday Season and everyone should be Merry and all that...    But when I'm doing Everything I Can to get my computer off the ground and YOU people are apparently doing everything you can to keep me from doing that--because of your own ineptitude, well...Someone has to say Something.    Call it ""tough love""--or give it some other name, but the bottom line is, YOUR bottom line is going to Bottom Out if You Don't Get Your Act Together and Start Fixing Your Own Problems.

You create something called ""plugin container"" and you have angered and outraged people Across The Globe--and you STILL haven't figured out a way to Fix The Problems It Causes?    When did you people Start Celebrating the holidays, anyway? Five Years Ago?    What is your Liquor Tab?    How can you Afford so many failed trips to Rehab?    And Who designed your Contact Us maze?    Did you think I was going to travel from NC to San Francisco to just stop by and see if anyone was actually alive in your office?    And what kind of Brain-Damaged War are you fighting with Kaspersky and the Adobe Flash people? Who is Stupid Enough to fight with companies that service the people YOU RELY ON?    Are You In There, Mozilla Firefox People?    Don't get me wrong.    I certainly do not expect a response from anyone at Mozilla Firefox, particularly from anyone in a position of responsibility. Hell, we know they've apparently been locked away in the top three floors of the most expensive hotel in Honolulu since at least 2013, and the only people who have seen them are top security officials who pretend not to notice the traffic in and out of the elevators--the fat, scruffy thugs with expensive brief cases and the party people...    It's horrible, but it would be perfect for and episode of Dateline NBC.    But it would be FUN to forward this message to whomever calls him or herself a kind of ""boss"" or ""director""--just to have it documented that someone at MozFf actually cared--and Tried to warn them, before Reality rolls in like a typhoon and blows them out of their penthouse suites--and rips the bottoms out of everyone's bank accounts, because people assume alternatives to MozFf and the business evaporates like Eastern Airlines, and it becomes a humorous memory like ""Alta Vista"".    By now, I imagine that you have surmised the gist of this text--so I'll not bore you with further expressing what is very obvious to more people than you can count.    In the past, I admit that I Enjoyed MozFf. But now, you're Bloated, Disappointing, Slow and Smug. Your nauseating Smiley/Frowny Face prompts that led to this page proves it.    I'd rather run into online trouble with an entity full of Smart People Who Care, rather than continue struggling with mistakenly proud people who really couldn't care less if their business thrived or died--and apparently couldn't repair their products if they tried.

Then, I can right-click any selected text, and search with MY chosen engine. When I do research, I often have to make multiple word/sentence searches from a single paragraph of plain text using several different search engines, and starting v43 I'm forced to manually copy everything into the search bar and then click on the search engine.
